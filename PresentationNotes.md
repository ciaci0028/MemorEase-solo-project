# Solo Project Presentation Prep

## Presentation Outline

- What problem are you solving?
    - In this day and age, many of us are constantly taking photos, trying to capture a glimpse of some of our favorite memories in life. For me, personally, I have a few potent photos that are just so precious and I find myself always going back to them and showing them off to others. When I upload them to Instagram or Facebook, they tend to get lost in a deep abyss of unorganized photos... And don't even get me started on my phone's long list of photos. Welcome to the market, MemorEase. A photo app to help oraganize our photos in a fun and customizable way. To demonstrate this app I am going to have my regular user, Lucille Ball, show off the features.
    - Lucy: I've been using MemorEase for quite some time now. I have a beautiful family and I love that I can keep all my favorite photos in one place. I am going to log in to my account [LOG IN]. One of my favorite things about the app is every time I log in or revisit the home screen, I am shown a random memory from my photo collection, and it's always a fun surprise of what I will see!
    - [List view] As I click on list view, I get to see my photos from the most recent to the oldest. I love that I can scroll through and every photo has so much meaning to me. However, instead of scrolling through all my photos, sometimes I like to just flood myself with one particular theme of memories. With MemorEase, there's an amazing filter option so I can just reminisce about my dog [Buddy], my cat [Kashmere], or either of my kids [Desi, Lucie]. This app is even useful to show progress pictures! When the pandemic hit, Ricky really wanted to get into shape, and he loves when I can show him his workout progress [Workout]. 
    - Uploading a photo is incredibly easy [Upload]. 


            
- Which technologies did you use?
    - Keep this brief. 
    - Technologies used by many students can be mentioned quickly without explanation
        - Example:
            > I used React, Redux, Node, Express, and Bootstrap.

    - Technologies only a few students are familiar with or not everyone used should be given a sentence
        - Example:
            > I used the Twilio API to send text messages.
            
- What was the toughest challenge you overcame?
    - This should be a success story. This should not be a complaint or beating yourself up. Remember, this is in-part practice for describing your project to recruiters and potential employers.
    - Example:
        > The toughest challenge I overcame was synchronizing all of the lists accross multiple users so that nothing was left off the list or overwritten.
- What is the 1 (one) next thing you are excited to tackle
    - This is to build excitement around your application.
    - This is not time for you to list all of the things you wish you would have accomplished.
    - Only 1 (ONE) thing should be listed here.
    - Example:
        > Now that the synchronized list is working, the next challenge I really excited to tackle push notifications to alert my siblings that I'm about to go to the store, so they should add items to the list soon!
        
        
 - Say thanks!
